  <p>NotebookGrader is a tool that makes it easy for instructors to assign homework consisting of Python Jupyter Notebooks, and for students to work on such homework and receive feedback.  The notebooks are shared on Google Drive, and students can work on their homework using <a href="https://colab.research.google.com">Google Colab</a>.  In particular, students do not need to install anything on their laptops: all they need is a browser.</p>
  
  <h2 class="subtitle mt-5">Notebooks Are Shared On Google Drive</h2>
  
  <p>When users (teachers or students) log in, NotebookGrader asks for two things:</p>
  
  <p class="mt-4"><b>Profile information.</b> This is used so that the instructor can know the identity of the students who did the homework, and so that we can associate the assignments with the instructors.</p>
  
  <p class="mt-4"><b>Permission to access <em>the files it creates</em> in Google Drive</b> so that it can share the homework with the students as Colab notebooks, and grade it.  NotebookGrader <em>only</em> has access to the notebooks it creates and shares, and does <em>not</em> have access to any other files on Google Drive.</p>
  
  <h2 class="subtitle mt-5">How It Works</h2>
  
  <p>Instructors create an assignment and upload a Python Jupyter notebook that specifies the homework assignment.  In these notebooks, some cells are read-only, in others the students can write their solutions, and other cells contain tests. Students get points if their solutions pass the tests. You can read the <a href="[[=URL('notebook-guidelines')]]">NotebookGrader note book format</a>, which is similar to the one used by <a href="https://nbgrader.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">nbgrader</a>.</p>
  
  <p class="mt-4">Students join assignments using invite URLs provided by the instructors.  When they join, they obtain the assignment as a <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/">Google Colab</a> notebook in their Google Drive, on which they can work. A Google Colab is a Python Notebook hosted by Google.</p>
  
  <p class="mt-4">When students are done working on their assignment, they can click on a <em>Grade</em> button. Their work is read from their notebook and graded, and students receive their grade and feedback immediately, again as a Colab notebook shared on Google Drive. Students can resubmit their work for grading a few times a day.</p>
  
  <p class="mt-4">Instructors can download all grades, and they also have access to the Colab Notebooks on which the students are working, so they can see in real-time how students are approaching the problems, and help them if needed.</p>
  
  <p class="mt-4">NotebookGrader can be used by instructors and students: please choose your role using the top bar.</p>
