  <p>NotebookGrader is a tool that makes it easy for instructors to assign homework consisting of Python Jupyter Notebooks, and for students to work on such homework and receive feedback.<p>
  
  <p class="mt-4">The idea is that it all happens on Google Drive, so all students need is a browser.  The instructor uploads a Jupyter notebook that becomes the assignment.  Students get a copy in their Google Drive when they join the assignment, work on it, then click a button, and receive both a grade and feedback, again shared on Drive.  The instructor has access to all the grades, and to all the notebooks on which the students work, making it easy to give them help in office hours or email/chat.</p>
  
  <p class="mt-4">When users (teachers or students) log in, NotebookGrader asks for two things:</p>
  
  <p class="mt-4"><b>Profile information.</b> This is used so that the instructor can know the identity of the students who did the homework, and so that we can associate the assignments with the instructors.</p>
  
  <p class="mt-4"><b>Permission to access <em>the files it creates</em> in Google Drive</b> so that it can share the homework with the students as Colab notebooks, and grade it.  NotebookGrader <em>only</em> has access to the notebooks it creates and shares, and does <em>not</em> have access to any other files on Google Drive.</p>

  <p class="mt-4">NotebookGrader can be used by instructors and students: please choose your role using the top bar.</p>
