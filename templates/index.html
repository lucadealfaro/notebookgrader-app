  <p>NotebookGrader makes it easy for instructors to assign homework consisting of Python Jupyter Notebooks, and for students to work on such homework and receive feedback.<p>
  
  <p class="mt-4">It all happens on Google Drive, and all students need is a browser.  The instructor uploads a Jupyter notebook that becomes the assignment.  Students get a copy in their Google Drive when they join the assignment, work on it, then click a button, and receive both a grade and feedback, again shared on Drive.  The instructor has access to all the grades, and to all the notebooks on which the students work, making it easy to give advice and help.</p>
  
  <p class="mt-4">NotebookGrader can be used by instructors and students: please choose your role using the top bar.</p>
