  <p>NotebookGrader is a tool that makes it easy for instructors to assign homework consisting of Python Jupyter Notebooks, and for students to work on such homework and receive feedback.<p>
  
  <p class="mt-4">The idea is that it all happens on Google Drive, so all students need is a browser.  The instructor uploads a Jupyter notebook that becomes the assignment.  Students get a copy in their Google Drive when they join the assignment, work on it, then click a button, and receive both a grade and feedback, again shared on Drive.  The instructor has access to all the grades, and to all the notebooks on which the students work, making it easy to give advice and help.</p>
  
  <p class="mt-4">When users (teachers or students) log in, NotebookGrader asks for two things: profile information, and the ability to access on Google Drive the files it creates. Profile information is used so that the instructor knows the identity of students. NotebookGrader has access only to the Colab Notebooks it creates, and <em>does not have access to the other files on Drive.</em></p>
  
  <p class="mt-4">NotebookGrader can be used by instructors and students: please choose your role using the top bar.</p>
